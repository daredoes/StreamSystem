"""
When an admin submits a form to create/edit an attendee/group/job/etc we usually want to perform some basic validations
on the data that was entered.  We put those validations here.  To make a validation for the Attendee model, you can
just write a function decorated with the @validation.Attendee decorator.  That function should return None on success
and an error string on failure.

In addition, you can define a set of required fields by setting the .required field like the AdminAccount.required list
below.  This should be a list of tuples where the first tuple element is the name of the field, and the second is the
name that should be displayed in the "XXX is a required field" error message.

To perform these validations, call the "check" method on the instance you're validating.  That method returns None
on success and a string error message on validation failure.
