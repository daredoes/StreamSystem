Weâ€™ve designed a 192 piece set of flat icons, and they are all yours, for free! The icons come in two versions: full color and single color, for a total of 384 variations. This download includes .ai, .eps, .pdf, and .png (64px and 128px). Below is the full set in both styles. These icons are completely free and Open Source under the GPL, so feel free to use them in your personal and commercial projects alike. We are on a mission to create the best collection of Open Source graphics on the web, so that the WordPress ecosystem can use and enjoy them alongside the freedoms they have become accustomed to. Stay tuned for more great stuff!
