<br/><br/>To help speed up check-in, please bring the 2D barcode below with you when you pick up your badge. You can print it out or display it on your phone.

You cannot pick up badges on behalf of other attendees, even if you have a copy of their barcode.

    {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} has a no-refund policy for all registrations.  If for any reason you can't make it, we allow and encourage
    you to resell your registration for the exact price you paid for it.  To transfer your registration to another person,
    send them <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/transfer_badge?id={{ attendee.id }}">this personalized link</a>,
    which will work until {{ c.FINAL_EMAIL_DEADLINE|datetime }}.
