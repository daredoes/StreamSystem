<h3 align="center"> How do I sign up to volunteer at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}? </h3>

All first-time volunteers must <a target="_blank" href="../preregistration/">preregister</a> for a badge.
When you preregister, simply select the "Sign me up!" checkbox indicating that you wish to volunteer and you'll
be contacted when shifts become available.

<br/> <br/>

If you're part of a group registration, you can sign up to volunteer when you pre-assign one of the group badges
to yourself.  Contact the person who preregistered your group to get the link you can use to pre-assign the badge
to yourself and volunteer.

<br/> <br/>

If you've already preregistered but didn't check the "Sign me up!" checkbox, then simply fill out your information
on the login form on the Volunteer Login page, and you'll be presented with a link allowing you to volunteer.

Volunteers are rewarded with tshirts, badge refunds, and even food!  <a href="stafferComps.html">Click here</a> to
