<h3 align="center"> Supporter Registration </h3>

We offer a special Supporter registration as a way for dedicated fans of {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}
to give us a little extra cash to help make the event better.  This is just one of
our <a href="givingExtra.html">donation levels</a>.

<br/> <br/>

The main thing you get as a Supporter is a special
swag bag.
As with all donation levels, you still get all of the swag from the lower donation levels,
and if you donate at a higher level, you still get the Supporter package.
