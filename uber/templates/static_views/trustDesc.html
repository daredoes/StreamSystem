<h3 align="center"> Restricted/Trusted </h3>

Some jobs require more trust than others.  For example, we don't want just
anyone working at the merch booth, since they handle a lot of our money.

<br/> <br/>

You may mark a job "Restricted" to ensure that only "Trusted" staffers can
sign up for it.  You may mark a staffer as being "Trusted" on the Staffer
admin page.

<br/> <br/>

In general, avoid making staffers trusted unless there are specific
Restricted shifts that you want them to be able to sign up for.  Don't
simply mark staffers as Trusted because you trust them.
