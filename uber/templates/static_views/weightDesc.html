<h3 align="center"> Weight </h3>

Some shifts deserve more compensation than other shifts.  For example, if you 
stay up all night or do a very difficult job then you should be rewarded.

<br/> <br/>

So every shift has a weight.  We multiply the number of hours in a shift by
the weight of that shift when calculating how many hours you're signed up for.

<br/> <br/>

So if you sign up for a 4 hour shift with a weight of 1.5, then it counts as
if you had worked 6 hours.
