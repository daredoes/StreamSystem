<h3 align="center"> Kicking in Extra Money </h3>

Want to give us a little extra cash to help make the festival better?  If you do, we'll
throw in a few special keepsakes!  Each donation level gets you an extra bit of swag,
in addition to all of the swag from all of the lower donation levels.  None of these
things (except the tshirt) will be for sale, so this is the only way to get them!

<br/> <br/>

The main donation tier is our <a href="supporters.html">Supporter package</a>.

<br/> <br/>

We also let you identify an <a href="affiliates.html">affiliate</a>; basically, this tells
us which groups are throwing the most financial support into {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} so that we can
reciprocate by doing cool things for those groups.
