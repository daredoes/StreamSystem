    <li><strong>JavaScript Disabled</strong>: We use Javascript to dynamically display our registration and payment form. Please make sure any script-blockers are turned off or disabled for this website.</li>
    <li><strong>Firewall Blocking</strong>: Some users may not be able to access our site from their place of work, as the form can be partially disabled by strict firewall rules. Please try accessing the form from home instead.</li>
