<h2> Dietary Restrictions </h2>

{% if attendee.badge_type == c.GUEST_BADGE %}
We feed our guests three meals per day during {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, and our chefs have an easier time planning meals
when they know what kind of food restrictions everyone has.
{% else %}
Thanks for volunteering, welcome to the fold! Please let us know any dietary restrictions or allergies below.
<br/> Volunteers who have met hour requirements for food will be served 3 meals a day and have access to staff suite 24 hours a day!

<br/> <br/><strong>We do not cook with dairy, corn, or seafood. Food with gluten or egg will always have alternatives.</strong>

    Please select any options that apply:<br/>

    Let us know if you have any other allergies or restrictions,
    please use commas to separate each allergy and food restriction.
    <br/><br/>Please note we are unable to accommodate every constraint, and the form below is not designed for preferences due to taste.

    <br/> <br/> <input type="submit" value="Save" /><br/>
    By clicking Save I agree that I have read the above information and indicated any restrictions requested.

    * We understand that there are different types of vegetarians/vegans, but due to the amount of food and restrictions we have to work with, we cannot accommodate all types. All vegetarian options would also be vegan.
