IMPORTANT NOTES FOR CHANGING/ADDING EMAIL CATEGORIES:

'ident' is a unique ID for that email category that must not change after emails in that category have started to send.
If an 'ident' is not set (not recommended), 'ident' will default to be the 'subject' line.

************************************************************************
IF IDENT IS NOT SET ON A CATEGORY, AND IF YOU CHANGE THE SUBJECT,
IT WILL CAUSE ANY EMAILS THAT HAVE ALREADY SENT TO RE-SEND.
************************************************************************

WORK WE NEED TO DO: Going forward, every single email category below should have an explicit 'ident' set. However,
mid-year we can't change the idents effectively because it will cause emails in these categories to be re-sent.

ident naming RULES:
 - every single email below should have an explicit ident paramater set. some don't and we should fix that up.
 - if no 'ident' is set, the ident is set to the 'subject'
 - name the ident anything you want, ideally something related to the email category i.e. "reg confirmation email"
 - HOWEVER, IF an ident was not explicitly sent, and you want to rename the subject, you must:
   - set the ident to the OLD subject first (do not include any {EVENT_NAME} in the ident)
     example: set the ident to exactly what the old subject is, without using variable names
     (e.g., "MAGFest 2017" instead of "{EVENT_NAME}")
   - set the subject to something different
